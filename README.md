# Alex Mathers – Resume
My name is Alex and I'm a Product Designer, Developer, and Illustrator. I've been building and designing products at @nudgerewards since 2016. 

Previously I've worked as a freelance designer and illustrator for various clients including Tommy Hilfiger, HomeStars, and The Toronto Star; and as an in-house designer at Maclean’s magazine.

I’m a lifelong Skier and outdoor-enthusiast. I like design systems, coding, and my dog Billy!
