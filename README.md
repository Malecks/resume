My name is Alex. I'm a Senior Product Designer at <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a>, where I focus on mobile design for entrepreneurs looking to start and grow their business. I built an app called <a href="bit.ly/PALette">Palette Cam</a>. I like anything and everything to do with digital art and creating interactive experiences.
