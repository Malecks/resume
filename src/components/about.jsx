            Hi! My name is Alex, I'm Product Designer with over 10 years of experience working on mobile and web as both a designer and developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my role as a product designer, I'm often thinking of the forest - leading large projects and multi-discipline teams, working with engineers and marketing alike, and I always consider the business and product perspectives.
          </p>
          <p> 
            But I live in the trees and understand the inherent value in shipping projects with an immaculate level of polish, and a delightful experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also literally live in the trees, in Vancouver, B.C. where I spend my weekends skiing, mountain biking, or hiking with my dog Billy.
          </p>
