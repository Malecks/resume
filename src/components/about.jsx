            Hi! My name is Alex, I'm currently a Senior Product Designer at <a href="https://shopify.com">Shopify</a>, where I focus on mobile design for entrepreneurs looking to start and grow their businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have over 10 years of experience working as a designer and developer, and I've spent the last 7 of those focused primarily on mobile apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like anything and everything to do with digital art and creating interactive experiences, and I find my best work happens when I'm sweating the details on a prototype for a big new idea or future thinking project. I care immensely and have a great eye for each pixel, animation, haptic, and sound that comes together to create a special moment for people. I'm often experimenting with new technologies and software, and have a laundry list of side-projects from React websites to Mobile apps and even a Crokinole game created in Unity.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my role as a product designer, I'm often thinking of the forest - leading large projects and multi-discipline teams, working with engineers and marketing alike, and I always consider the business and product perspectives. But I live in the trees and understand the inherent value in shipping projects with an immaculate level of polish, and a delightful experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also literally live in the trees, in Vancouver, B.C. where I spend my weekends skiing, mountain biking, or hiking with my dog Billy.
