          <p>
            I'm an experienced brand builder with agency roots and a business education. I help brands come to life through compelling and impactful storytelling, striking a perfect balance between business and creativity.

          <p>
            I've had the privilege of working with global fashion and lifestyle brands through both agency work and in-house positions.

          <p>
            My forte lies in distilling brand positioning and crafting strategic stories that meet customers at the right place, at the right time. I have a soft spot for brands that look good and do good, and I thrive in developing campaigns that simultaneously exceed brand and impact goals.
